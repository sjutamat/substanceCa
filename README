**Toxicity Trends Analysis Project**
Welcome to the Toxicity Trends Analysis Project repository! This project explores trends in opioid and
stimulant toxicity deaths in Canada from 2018 to 2024 using Python, SQL, and public health data. Here, 
you'll find all the code, datasets, and insights behind the analysis. If you're curious about the technical 
details or want to build upon this work, you've come to the right place!

**Project Overview**

This project aims to uncover meaningful insights from public health data Canada by:

1. Analyzing trends in stimulant- and opioid-related deaths.

2. Comparing substances like methamphetamine, cocaine, and fentanyl.

3. Highlighting disparities and changes over time to inform discussions and solutions.

The dataset is sourced from the Public Health Agency of Canada and is publicly available on [Open.Canada.ca](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/1092497d-6c72-4e66-930b-9d6337e64af5).

**Repository Structure**

Here's what you'll find in this repository:

1. Code

cleaning.ipynb: Handles data preprocessing and cleaning.

eda.ipynb: Contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.

2. SQL
substance.sql: Contains the sql commands were using during the process.

3. Data

Dataset: Preprocessed and raw data files (with source attribution).

4. Output

Visualizations: Graphs comparing stimulant and opioid trends over time.

5. Documentation

README.md: This file.

**How to Use This Repository**

---Prerequisites---

1. Install Python (3.7 or higher).

2. Install required libraries by running:

    ```python
